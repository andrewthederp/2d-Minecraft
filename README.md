My interpretation of a 2d minecraft. This is made in pygame.
I wasn't planning on making this open source so the code is very bad.

---
## TODO
  - Add documentation
  - Add proper lighting
  - Make it more efficent
  - Add crafting tables and make leaves drop normal stuff
  - Stairs change direction when being left clicked on
  - Player gets teleported to the side of the stiars when trying to walk off

## Done
  - Fixed slabs/stairs
  - Fixed bug where player starts slow falling when hitting the empty gab in a stair (Not sure if this is actually fixed but it seems like it)
  - Fixed bug where player can jump mid-air if collided with the empty gab in a stair
